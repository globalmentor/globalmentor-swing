/**
 * Indicates that this view can be hidden. Although all views can be "hidden" by their being covered by another window, implementing this interface means that
 * the view expects it might be a child of a view that shows only a portion of its views at a time, such as an {@link XMLPagedView}. In such an example,
 * <em>all</em> views would be hidden at times, but only those that implement this interface will be informed that they are about to be hidden. The
 * implementation, therefore, functions much like an even listener that is automatically added as a listener when added to the view hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * A component view, for instance, might need to know when it is being hidden so as to tell its component to be made not visible.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that hiding a view should not necessarily make that view not visible, although a view may need to set a related component to be not visible. Normal
 * views need to take no action (and therefore do not need to implement this interface) when being hidden; they simply will not be painted.
