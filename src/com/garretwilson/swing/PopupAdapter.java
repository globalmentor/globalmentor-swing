/**An adapter that can be added as a listener for mouse events, popping

<p>An instance of this class may installed into a component by calling

	listener.</p> 
<p>Typical uses of this class include any of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Constructing the class with a default popup menu to always use.</li>
		<li>Overriding {@link PopupAdapter#getPopupMenu()} to dynamically create a popup
			menu.</li>
		<li>Overriding {@link PopupAdapter#getPopupMenu(Component, int, int)} to
			dynamically create a popup menu based on the specified coordinates in the
			given component.</li>
