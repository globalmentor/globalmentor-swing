/**A sequence panel that determines the sequence based upon components that
	implement the {@link Sequenceable} interface.
<p>The class is constructed with an initial component to display. Subsequently,
	if the component implements {@link Sequenceable}, returns
	<code>true</code> for {@link Sequenceable#hasNext()}, and the
	<code>Sequenceable.getNext()</code> method returns a {@link Component},
	that component will be displayed next in the sequence, etc. The sequence will
	be allowed to finish once a component is reached that returns
	<code>false</code> for {@link Sequenceable#hasNext()}.</p>
<p>The current collected sequence of components are kept in an internal stack,
	an can be iterated at any time using
	{@link #getSequenceHistoryIterator()}. This iterator will return all
	components starting with the initial component up to but not including the
	current component, which can be returned using
	{@link #getContentComponent()}./p>
